# StockBuddy
We propose a stock market recommender system that analyses stock data and suggests a ranked basket of stocks. The objective of this recommender system is to support stock market traders, individual investors and fund managers in their decisions. Recommender systems apply different techniques of data mining on data and find similarities among various data items using live prices, historical data and news articles.
